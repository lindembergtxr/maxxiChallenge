# Maxxi Geolocation Todos

This project is a small geospatial-enabled Todo application built as part of a technical assessment.

The application allows users to create, view, and manage todos that include an associated geographic location.
It showcases core concepts such as state management, component-driven UI design, data persistence, and basic geospatial handling (e.g., storing coordinates, visualizing points, or interacting with a map provider depending on the implementation).

The focus is on clean structure, clarity of code, and maintainability rather than feature breadth.
